# Random-Fact-Telephone
A retrofitted rotary dial phone with text-to-speech, a generative pre-trained transformer to give listeners a LLM generated fact.


## Description

The telephone is a fun project that utilizes a retrofitted rotary telephone as a tangible, tactile interface for artificial intelligence. Built upon technologies such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT3.5, OpenAI's Audio API, and a Raspberry Pi 3b+.

## Motivation

The motivation behind GenAI-Telephone stemmed from a desire to diverge from traditional, screen-based interfaces that are the most familiar of digital interfaces in our modern lives. By repurposing a nostalgic rotary telephone, my goal is to invoke the past to interact with the technology of the present, allowing users to experience the capabilities of AI magic in a differntly engaging and refreshing manner. It is supposed to be a conversations starter on the topics of user interfaces, user experiences, AI safety, chat bots and their personas, as well as circularity of prototypes and demonstrators.

## Dependencies (hardware and services)

- OpenAI API key for text generation and speech synthesis as a service
- (optional) Azure's Text-To-Speech API for clear and natural language output (alternative: ![coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS))
- Raspberry Pi Zero W, 3b and later
- a rotary telephone
- 3.5mm jack audio USB adapter
- Audio Male to 2 or 3-Pin screw terminal
- soldering iron

## Installation (Hardware)

- disassemble the telephone, making sure that none of the plastics get damaged in the process.

- take out the inner parts of the telephone. For it, we will need a screwdriver and some wiggling around of the parts.

- It can be advantageous to desolder some of the pins and electronics in order to gain room for the raspberry pi.

- prepare some female-to-female GPIO cables

- and solder them to the rotary dial (yellow and green), button (green and brown), spring mechanism of the switch hook (which ever connections act as a button)

- connect the cables of the handset to the Audio Pin screw terminal with the 3.5mm jack. Plug that into the Raspberry Pi 3b. Alternatively, plug the pin into the USB adapter and connect the adapter to the USB connection of the Raspberry Pi 4 or 5.
- find the ground pins for the raspberry pi.
- the rotary dial should be connected to GPIO pin 2
- the black button should be connected to GPIO pin 3
- the switch hook spring/button should be GPIO pin 26

## Dependencies (OS, Python)
Once Raspian and the general infrastructure is set up and the usual updates are installed using 

    sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
the following dependencies should be installed:

    sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-scipy python3-rpi.gpio sox gnuplot libsox-fmt-all ffmpeg libasound-dev libportaudio2 && pip install requests playsound numpy sounddevice Unidecode 

Copy the repo:

```
git clone -b Random-Fact-Telephone https://github.com/030jmk/genAI-telephone.git  

```

### Setting up an environmental variable for the API key
Since it is likely that you would not want to have the API Keys as a string within the script, an evironmental variable may be set. On a rasperry pi this may look like this:
1. Open the .bashrc File:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  
```
2. Add the Environment Variable by scrolling to the bottom of the file and adding the following line:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'  
```
3. Save and Close the File by pressing Ctrl + X to exit and pressing Y and ENTER to save the changes.
4. Apply the Changes:
```
source ~/.bashrc 
```

To execute the script in the folder that was cloned from the repo
```
python whisper.py
```

### Automated start and restart
1. Copy the .service file to the systemd system directory:
```
sudo cp whisper.service /etc/systemd/system/
```
2. Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service file:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
3. Enable the service to start on boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable whisper.service
```
4. Check the status of the service to ensure it's running:
```
sudo systemctl status whisper.service
```



## In Action
The demo was presented at [Berlin Hack & Tell #89](https://berlinhackandtell.rocks/2023-07-25-no89-camping-hacks) 2023-07-25 and can now be tested and seen at the PwC Experience Center in Berlin and Frankfurt.
