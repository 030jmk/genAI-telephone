# genAI-telephone
A retrofitted rotary dial phone with speech-to-text, a generative pre-trained transformer and text-to-speech.


## Description

The telephone is a fun project that utilizes a retrofitted rotary telephone as a tangible, tactile interface for artificial intelligence. Built upon technologies such as OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API, which solves speech-to-text tasks, GPT-3.5, a fined-tuned version of the GPT3 (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) model, Azure's Text to speech REST API, and a Raspberry Pi Zero W, 3b or 4.

## Motivation

The motivation behind GenAI-Telephone stemmed from a desire to diverge from traditional, screen-based interfaces that are the most familiar of digital interfaces in our modern lives. By repurposing a nostalgic rotary telephone, my goal is to invoke the past to interact with the technology of the present, allowing users to experience the capabilities of AI magic in a differntly engaging and refreshing manner. It is supposed to be a conversations starter on the topics of user interfaces, user experiences, AI safety, chat bots and their personas, as well as circularity of prototypes and demonstrators. 

## Dependencies (hardware and services)

- OpenAI's Whisper API (alternative: ![self hosted whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)) and GPT-3.5 (alternative: llama2) for speech recognition and text generation
- Azure's Text-To-Speech API for clear and natural language output (alternative: ![coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS))
- Raspberry Pi Zero W or 3b and later
- a rotary telephone
- a microphone from an old headset
- 2in1 mic/audio USB adapter
- TRRS Audio Male to 4-Pin screw terminal
- soldering iron

## Installation (Hardware)

- disassemble the telephone, making sure that none of the plastics get damaged in the process.

- take out the inner parts of the telephone. For it, we will need a screwdriver and some wiggling around of the parts.

- It can be advantageous to desolder some of the pins and electronics in order to gain room for the raspberry pi.

- prepare some female-to-female GPIO cables

- and solder them to the rotary dial (yellow and green), button (green and brown), spring mechanism of the switch hook (which ever connections act as a button)

- connect the cables of the handset to the TRRS Audio Male to 4-Pin screw terminal, plug the TRRS pin into the USB adapter and connect the adapter to the USB connection of the pi.
- find the ground pins for the raspberry pi.
- the rotary dial should be connected to GPIO pin 2
- the black button should be connected to GPIO pin 3
- the switch hook spring/button should be GPIO pin 26

## Dependencies (OS, Python)
Once Raspian and the usual updates are installed using 

    sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
the following dependencies should be installed:

    sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-scipy python3-rpi.gpio sox gnuplot libsox-fmt-all ffmpeg libasound-dev libportaudio2 && pip install requests playsound numpy sounddevice Unidecode 

test the mic set up once everything is connected:

    arecord -f cd -c 1 -r 44100 | sox -t raw -r 44100 -e signed -b 16 -c 1 -V - -t raw - | gnuplot -persist -e "set xlabel 'Time'; set ylabel 'Amplitude'; plot '-' with lines"


While waiting for an answer from the phone, elevator music may be used. "Yesterday (Jazz Elevator)" by Monument_Music is used for the current code:

Since it is likely that you would not want to have the API Keys as a string within the script, an evironmental variable may be set. On a rasperry pi this may look like this:
1. Open the .bashrc File:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  
```
2. Add the Environment Variable by scrolling to the bottom of the file and adding the following line:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'  
```
3. Save and Close the File by pressing Ctrl + X to exit and pressing Y and ENTER to save the changes.
4. Apply the Changes:
```
source ~/.bashrc 
```
